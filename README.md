# HAI (HIL-based Augmented ICS) Security Dataset
The HAI dataset was collected from a realistic industiral control system (ICS) testbed augmented with a Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) simulator that emulates steam-turbine power generation and pumped-storage hydropower generation.

## Background

- In 2017, three laboratory-scale CPS testbeds were initially launched, namely GE’s turbine testbed, Emerson’s boiler testbed, and FESTO’s modular production system (MPS) water-treatment testbed. These testbeds are related to relatively simple processes, and were operated independently of each other.

- In 2018, a complex process system was built to combine the three systems using a HIL simulator, where the generation of thermal power and pumped-storage hydropower was simulated. This ensured that the variables were highly coupled and correlated for a richer dataset. In addition, an open platform communications united architecture (OPC-UA) gateway was installed to facilitate data collection from heterogeneous devices.

- The first version of HAI dataset, HAI 1.0,  was made available on GitHub and Kaggle in February 2020. This dataset included ICS operational data from normal and anomalous situations for 38 attacks. Subsequently, a debugged version of HAI 1.0, namely HAI 20.07, was released for the HAICon 2020 competition in August 2020.

- HAI 21.03 was released in 2021, and was based on a more tightly coupled HIL simulator to produce clearer attack effects with additional attacks. This version provides more quantitative information and covers a variety of operational situations, and provides better insights into the dynamic changes of the physical system.

- HAI 22.04 contained more sophisticated attacks that are significantly more difficult to detect than those in the previous versions. Comparing only the baseline TaPRs of HAICon 2020 and HAICon 2021, detection difficulty in HAI 22.04 is approximately four times higher than HAI 21.03.

## HAI Testbed
The testbed consists of four different processes: boiler process, turbine process, water treatement process and HIL simulation:

- **Boiler Process (P1):** This includes water-to-water heat trasfer at a low pressure and a moderate temperature. This process is controlled using Emerson Ovation DCS.
- **Turbine Process (P2):** A rotor kit process that closely simulates the behavior of an actual rotating machine. It is controlled by GE's Mark VIe DCS.
- **Water treatment Process (P3):** This process includes pumping water to the upper reservoir and releasing it back into the lower reservoir. It is controlled by Siemens's S7-300 PLC.

- **HIL Simulation(P4):** Both the boiler and turbine processes are interconnected to synchronize with the rotating speed of the virtual steam-turbine power generation model. The pump and value in the water-treatment process are controlled by the pumped-storage hydropower generation model. The dSPACE's SCALEXIO system is used for the HIL simulations and is interconnected with the real-world processes through a Siemens S7-1500 PLC and ET200 remote IO devices for data-acquisition system based on the OPC gateway.


## HAI Dataset
Two major versions of HAI datasets have been released thus far. Each dataset consists of several CSV files, and each file satisfies time continuity. The quantitative summary of each version are as follows:
> **Note:** The **version numbering** follows a **date-based scheme**, where the version number indicates the released date of the HAI dataset.  HAI 20.07 is the bug-fixed version of HAI v1.0 released in February 2020.

### Data fields 
                
The time-series data in each CSV file satisfies time continuity. The first column represents the observed time in the “yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss” format, while the rest of the columns provide the recorded SCADA data points. The last four columns provide data labels for whether an attack occurred. Out of these four columns, is applicable to all the process and the other three columns are applicable to the corresponding control processes.
                
> Refer to the **latest technical manual** for the details for each column.
                
> From the HAI 22.04 version, attack labels for each process (attack_p1, attack_p2, attack p3) have been excluded. This is because they can be replaced by the attack targets (controllers and points) provided for each dataset version.

## Performance Metric

In this study, we built a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)-based augmented ICS (HAI) testbed and developed ICS security datasets. Here, we introduce the second dataset (HAI 21.03), which was developed with the user feedback of the first released version (HAI 20.07). All HAI datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/icsdataset/hai. HAI 21.03 was expanded by adding data points and normal/attack scenarios to HAI 20.07. We also held an AI-based anomaly detection contest (HAICon 2020) utilizing the HAI datasets developed so far, giving many AI researchers an opportunity to discuss and share ideas for ICS anomaly detection research. This paper presents the results of the HAICon 2020. The results of the top teams in the competition can be used as a performance comparison criterion when using HAI 21.03. },

    abstract = {Datasets are paramount to the development of AI-based technologies. However, the available cyber-physical system (CPS) datasets are insufficient. In this paper, we introduce the HIL-based augmented ICS security (HAI) dataset 1.0 (https://github.com/icsdataset/hai), the first CPS dataset collected using the HAI testbed. The HAI testbed comprises three physical control systems, namely GE turbine, Emerson boiler, and FESTO water treatment systems, combined through a dSPACE hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulator. We built an environment to remotely and automatically manipulate all components of a feedback control loop. Using this environment, we collected the HAI dataset 1.0 while repeatedly running a large number of benign and malicious scenarios for a long period with minimal human effort. We will continue to improve the HAI testbed and release new versions of the HAI dataset.},
